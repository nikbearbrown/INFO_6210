It's been about ten days since I've posted anything here. And while there's been a lot of things happening throughout the country and the world, not much has happened in my little corner of the planet. Except maybe the cold front that has been with us for a few days. \n\nWell, I don't mean COLD in the same way anyone back home in the Berkshires (the hills of Western Massachusetts) would mean it, but cold for Florida which strikes me as kind of funny. When I saw a woman with big furry boots, and a fur lined hoodie, obviously freezing in 50 degree weather - Well it just has a tendency to put a smile on your face. That same 50 degrees willI be t-shirt weather back home this coming March. Guess you get used to things wherever you are.\n\nI try to remain un-climatized so that I can feel comfy almost anywhere. That means jumping into cold water, wandering around in less than appropriate apparel etc., which helps but doesn't actually help all that much. Which is probably why I'm writing this from Florida in the first pace. It also partially explains why I have so many Canadian neighbors around here.\n\nWe've been going through a cold spell politically as well as climatically in my estimation. But, I'm beginning to sense a warming trend in that as well. Might be an illusion or just my own take on the trends of our times. It's still too early to call perhaps, but sometimes you just get a whiff of things changing and it puts a smile on your face just like a change in the weather.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but it would sure be nice to start feeling good again. Starting trusting each other like we used to. And starting being able to argue and fight, then go out for a beer together afterward. I don't agree or disagree with anyone 100% of the time anyway.\n\nIn fact one of my favorite J.R.R. Tolkein quotes sums it up pretty well. “I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.” And I don't even know what he just said! But, it sounds at least about half right.\n\nThat said, I'm looking forward to today. Might even be better than yesterday. I got a good start this morning by getting up at some ridiculously early hour, and wandering outside, coffee in hand, to see what was going on.

I was performing on stage near the exact spot where 200 years earlier, armed patriots engaged the British occupying forces. \n\nI remember President Ford and a contingent of supporters coming up to the site on the same path the redcoats had taken two centuries earlier.

Soon afterward a congressional committee was set up to prove that the People's Bicentennial was somehow a left-wing plot to overthrow the Untied States. The people who attended the celebration couldn't have cared less about the histories of some of the organizers. We were there to have a party and celebrate not only the history, but the direction that history had chosen for us to continue the struggle in our own time and in our own ways.

I've been to this area before and I remember the time we were playing Lupo's - A long time ago. We arrived to find some guys sitting around a card table enjoying a game of cards on stage. They were annoyed that we had to disturb them while we brought in the gear. That was pretty funny. I have no idea if that place is still around or not. \n\nWe're not all that far from Newport, RI either. I first went there as a kid in the early 1960s. My mom had asked a young Bob Dylan if he could take me along, as I probably wouldn't be too much trouble. He obliged and we walked around the Newport Folk Festival. That might've been 1963. I came back a few years later, and everything changed. I essentially became the person I've been for the last 50 years.\n\nSo there's lots of memories - I've mentioned only a couple. But, it's great to be back in this part of the world and we're looking forward to the gig tonight here in Cranston in this lovely venue...""},",952,46, 96),236196,tag:

I think it'll hold up well, altho I expect that we will have lost much of the contents before it's safe to return and begin the clean-up. It's going to be much much worse for many neighbors and friends, where insurance won't come close to covering their immediate losses much less cover the costs of rebuilding with newer and more costly building codes in effect. \n\nNewer building codes are always a result of a compromise between potential risk versus a practical affordability. The point is, many older, retired,  fixed income residents will not be allowed to rebuild what they've lost. And there's no way for them to afford to comply with updated building codes. What happens to them? Many are driving away from homes and lives they know they will never see again. \n\nI am reminded of the songs my father wrote 80 years ago when he, his family, friends and neighbors became dust bowl refugees. The long lines of cars leaving Florida look eerily familiar to anyone who has some familiarity with those times. These environmental refugees have a long road ahead of them.  Some may not survive the journey. \n\nFrom Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida they’re on a road to an unknowable future. Let’s hope they are not driving into an unrecognizable country. They’re going to need more than simple supplies.

The early feedback on the live shows was clear: lose the sketches. So the songs endured and they all remain because the band hates to throw anything out. The songs were written to make fun of a big dumb world. Luckily, the world is still dumb and The Arrogant Worms (Mike McCormick, Chris Patterson and Trevor Strong) still have plenty to sing about. The shows are fast, furious and family friendly. The wit is quick, the satire is biting and the musicianship is second to none. Their appeal has earned them fans from kids to parents to grandparents to Princess Leia. The Arrogant Worms have sold more than 160,000 copies of their 14 albums. The band has played on three continents to crowds as large as 100,000 and were recognized in 2003 as the Touring Act of the Year by the Canadian Arts Presenters Association. The Worms have entertained at corporate functions, sung anthems at sporting events and emceed at major festivals. Their songs are in school lesson plans, in textbooks and even played on the Space Shuttle. On earth or in space, everyone digs these Worms. Over a quarter century after they began, The Arrogant Worms continue to provide tuneful and silly escapism for everyone who needs it. And if you think you don’t need it, well you’re wrong. You do. The Arrogant Worms know what’s best for you and what’s best for you is The Arrogant Worms.',",37,, 7),15439,tag:

Since the ‘70s, they’ve been blending elements of pop, punk and even metal in a way that is instantly catchy and recognizable. With timeless classics such as “I Want You to Want Me” and “Surrender,” CHEAP TRICK, now with drummer Daxx Nielsen, are a musical institution. The Rockford, IL band is as vital today as ever, having released three records in the last three years -- BANG ZOOM CRAZY...HELLO (2016), WE’RE ALL ALRIGHT (2017) and CHRISTMAS CHRISTMAS (2017) –and toured relentlessly to packed audiences around the world. 2016 saw CHEAP TRICK\'s long-awaited induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction honored both the band and the pioneering sound that has earned them total record sales well in excess of 20 million featured appearances and more than 40 international Gold and Platinum certifications. 2017’s WE\'RE ALL ALRIGHT! was yet another undisputed triumph for the band as the album\'s first single, ""Long Time Coming,"" enjoyed an unprecedented run of 18 weeks at #1 on the Mediabase Classic Rock chart.\n\nCheck out the “Poison…Nothin’ But A Good Time 2018” tour at any of the following stops.  \n\nDATE CITY VENUE \n \nFri 5/18 Irvine, CA Five Points Amphitheatre\n* Sat 5/19 Las Vegas, NV The Joint\nSun 5/20 Reno, NV Grand Sierra Resort\nTue 5/22 Salt Lake City, UT USANA Amphitheatre\nWed 5/23 Denver, CO Fiddler’s Green Amphitheatre\nFri 5/25 Kansas City, KS Sprint Center\n* Sat 5/26 St. Louis, MO Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre\nThu 5/31 Nashville, TN Ascend Amphitheatre\n* Sat 6/2 Dallas, TX Toyota Pavilion at Irving Music Factory\n* Sun 6/3 Houston, TX Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n* Tue 6/5 Atlanta, GA Verizon Amphitheatre\nThu 6/7 Indianapolis, IN Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center\n* Fri 6/8 Detroit, MI DTE Energy Music Theatre\n* Sat 6/9 Chicago, IL Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre\n* Sun 6/10 Cincinnati, OH Riverbend Music Center\n* Tue 6/12 Cleveland, OH Blossom Music Center\nWed 6/13 Syracuse, NY Lakeview Amphitheatre\nThu 6/14 Hartford, CT The Xfinity Theatre\nFri 6/15 Gilford, NH Bank of NH Pavilion\n* Sun 6/17 Bristow, VA Jiffy Lube Live\nTue 6/19  Toronto, ONT.
