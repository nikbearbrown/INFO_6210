Not the guy on his laptop that is working during the baseball game instead of enjoying it.","Stop the unrealistic expectations with you. Tell your boss no once in a while.

Company pays well and had some great benefits. Performance bonuses are based on the team/ project that you’re connected with and not for individual efforts. So if you’re lucky to get great project then you’re recognized with great bonus.

Lack of stability and no raise for years. No career advancement.,Retain good talent. The company really have great people with valuable knowledge and experience.
