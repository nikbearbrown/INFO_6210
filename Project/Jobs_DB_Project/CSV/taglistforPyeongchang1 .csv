so i read this interview
where alina says that she really wants a dog
because she really enjoys to take care of her pets (chinchillas an a cat)
and she can tell them things that she can't tell her parents
that they will never betray her
her mom told her 'we will think about the dog if you will have a good performance at the olympics'
she really just a kid
a young and a bit lonely kid
who won against the sentimental favorite
and i really wish there was more empathy for her
because the system is broken but it's really not alina's fault

watching yuzu win gold again after all his injuries and time off ice
and tessa and scott coming back on top as legends
zhenya getting the silver but showing us she was more than what the colour of her medal said
and so many more
so so many more moments
it's been a privilege to watch
😢😢😢

I don't understand why there is hostility between ARMY's and EXO-L's
i mean
sure EXO's been getting a bad rap lately
but their only human
humans make mistakes
and don't direct any hate of that producer guy on to the group itself
it's that guy and the record companies problem not the guys'
:(
as a former exo stan I'm enjoying this in general but yknow
Bring it on boys😀

i'm going to cry over this my whole life
im not a fan of the way she (alina) performs but im sure she probably earned her technical score
fs is a sport after all so a beautiful performance may not be a winning one
but damn
thats brutal
i read that some of evgenia’s and shoma’s jumps werent textbook but werent called either
(but idk man i cant tell. also i need somebody to analyse alina’s as well?)
(but maybe theyre so good they dont need to be called so no ones said a thing)

bronze medal!!

zagitova won on tehnical alone tbh
I almost fell during her FP it was so boring
ah well
who cares about artistry when you can jump really well. right?
anyway
evgenia should have won
MY RUSSIAN WEEABOO WAS ROBBED!!!!!!
zhenya's been robbed and i'm upset
2018 olympics spoilers
i'm mad and sad wtf
i cried when she cried
and when her and alina hugged
she handled it so well
she is a beautiful person
