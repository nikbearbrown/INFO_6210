Bank Of America,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Bank-of-America-Reviews-E8874.htm,4/18/2019, Client Service Representative,"Dallas, TX",Current Employee ,Client service Representative,Less than a year,0,"Bank of America is an amazing company that offers amazing benefits, tuition reimbursement, employee discounts, and much more! In addition, Bank of America, is one of the highest paying banks.
Bank of America really cares about its employees. The morale was great and I loved my team!","I wasn’t a fan of customer service. This was my first customer service job, so I really struggled with this position. I had a 10 hour shift and I took back to back calls for the whole shift(I’m not exaggerating. Management monitored our phone time and would IM us if our phone line was unavailable.) We got two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch break. It was a very stressful work environment; I took a lot of escalated calls and I felt like a therapist half of the time. I eventually got burned out and quit the job.","My managers were great! The only thing I would suggest is that Bank of America, needs to find new ways to lower the high call volume in the call centers. Customer service is a stressful job on its own, but when require your employees to take back to back phone calls for 8-10 hours, it can cause employees to feel stressed, burned out, and overwhelmed.
Many of my coworkers had panic attacks and mental breakdowns because of the job. My coworkers worked in customer service for 4+ years, and have never experienced so much stress.",5,3,5,5,5,5
