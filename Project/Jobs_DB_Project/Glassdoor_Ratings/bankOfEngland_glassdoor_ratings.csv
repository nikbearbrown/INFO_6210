Pretty building",More and more work piled on and nothing ever taken away. The people who project themselves better get all the recognition whether or not they do the best job. The bloated Central Services function appears to justify its existence by creating complicated and bureaucratic systems for everything. The rest of the staff has to waste time on this bureaucracy.

Your job doesn’t really matter as no senior accountability when things go wrong.
Does look good on the CV.
Pension is best in the city by some margin.
Good for old timers on old (better) pay arrangements.
Flexible working","You’ll drown in paperwork and committees, not to mention emails and meetings. Nothing will get done and you’ll have the same discussions this time next year. For those that want to get ahead and do things, the place will drain you of any energy, and you’ll slowly morph into a jaded lump of slime.

Pay reviews are the most unfair, despite there being inordinate amount of reviews and the like. It’s exceptionally clique based despite the rhetoric.

IT is the worst ive seen in two decades, good luck finding a laptop that actually functions.

Canteen price gouging and quality v poor- 1.60£ for a croissant - taking the mickey.

The people I directly worked with were a great bunch. Very hard working and conscientious.","If you want to give up your personality and become a small piece of a massive working machine, underpaid with no pay rise for many years, together with no hope of promotion then this is the perfect job.

Stress levels are through the roof and a number of people in the department (inc. myself) were seeing the staff councillor to try and relieve the stress.

Management attitude towards the staff is dictatorial - to say the least. Get the work done and complete unbelieveable admin work - or else!

Want to show initiative ? Don't bother. It gets ignored and someone else (normally a manager) will have a better idea of their own.

Too many senior staff making too many changes that directly affect the welfare of the staff with a ""Its being changed for our futures""","Trust your staff.
