    "### Two Choices: 1) Jobs Database or 2) Create Learning Materials to Teach SQL or NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a choice to contribute to the jobs database or to contribute to a \"Bantaba\" project related to databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jobs Database \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project students will contribute to building a jobs database using mysql and python with proper documentation. Students will each focus on job domains like computational biology jobs, finance jobs, game analytics, game AI, data visualization jobs, Tableau jobs, Northeastern jobs, small lab jobs, etc..  \n",
    "The database is focused around an employer like a company and research lab. Each student should collect information on at least 300 employers.    \n",

    "_The Project_\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given the beginnings of a jobs database but the previous developer was let go because the organization of the previous project is a mess. The developers all worked independently and the tables and schemas didn’t match. There are some working scripts but they sometimes replicate and some are missing. Some scripts have bugs and may be in python 2.7.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is in .csv, json, sqlite and mysql.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to salvage what data, schemas and scripts that you can and add what is missing.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything must be done in mysql using the InnoDB engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "All python scripst must be in python 3 or above and using Google Python Style Guide http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html\n",

    "One domain can be work on by groups of up to 3 people.  E-mail the TAs to make sure your domain isn’t taken.  Jobs is too broad for a domain, domains are computational biology jobs, finance jobs, game analytics, game AI, data visualization jobs, Tableau jobs, Northeastern jobs, small lab jobs, etc. It is OK to have some overlap between domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "One you have a domain do the following tasks:  \n",
    "1. Build the list of companies in some domain.  \n",
    "2. Web scrape the data for each of the companies for job details.   \n",
    "3. Automate the scraping.   \n",
    "4. Get additional relevant data from sites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn (one per person)   \n",
    "5. Get data from social media sites – Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Steam, Twitter, etc.. (One per person)  \n",
    "6. Tag the social media posts, including synonyms for the tags   \n",
    "7. Clean and integrate data.   \n",
    "8. Build an ER diagram and model the db.   \n",
    "9. Build the dB schema and insert the data   \n",
    "10. Generate use cases.   \n",
    "11. Optimize the database.    \n",
    "12. Properly document that database\n",

    "\n",
    "This is part of the \"Bantaba\" projects. This is an excericse in technical writing and creating hands-on learning materials. The idea is to _teach_ another NEU Master's student a techical subject related databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like this option. Add yourself to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eXETwf111YiZjh62ogtIslp723JKJL0rcHtapZpMGss/edit?usp=sharing and add database related choices for your first and second choices.  \n",

    "All of the projects will start by writing the outline of a short book/guide to the topic.\n",

    "The idea behind these books/courses is the create VERY hands-on labs and learning materials. Learn by doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give us an outline of what needs to be done and be the basis to write a grant.\n",
