I applied for this position which would be working from home and this company tried to scam me. Luckily I read the reviews and listened to my mother and did some research about it. The company itself is real and they offer real jobs, but the company is so big that people pose as hiring managers for the company. They will contact you through email and via text about your interest in the job. They will then make you down Google Hangout. They will ask you a series of questions and then by the end of the interview tell you got the job. IT’S A SCAM! The job offer isn’t real they just tell you that. They offer to send to money for “ work supplies “ but really they just want you to deposit a FRAUDULENT check so they can have access to your account. They make the job and the benefits sound really good and make you think that you got this IMAGINARY job but it’s all a SCAM. Please stay away, and make sure that if it an actual job offer not people trying to scam you. If they try to make you download a messaging app or Google Hangouts it’s a scam.

He was fired from Sonic automotive for stealing from the company. His antics continue here. Highest turnover in all of BHA? Coincidence??? Look into his recent purchase of a Range Rover. Vehicle was traded for way behind fair market value. Then it was hidden(so no one could sell it). Then the cost was massively written down due to aging. Then to add insult to injury a trade was added where he gave himself more than a brand new one would cost. This is only the tip of the iceberg with this guy. He will stain Betkshires name eventually.
When I worked there I saw everything. Credit applications were regularly falsified. This was a not a one off ocurrence. It is a culture that is common practice in this store.
